# NAMM Product Essential

Welcome to 'NAMM Product Essential'  Template (VERSION=NSPE1.0)

The purpose of the NAMM  Product Essential Excel Doc is to create a standardized format for suppliers, distributors, 3rd party software vendors and retailers to disseminate and consume product price lists (sometimes referred to as "Build Sheets")

Suppliers and their resale partners gain efficiencies by having as single standardized document that 1000's of downstream distributors and retailers can programmatically consume into ERP and retail POS systems. This Excel Document contains four tabs (uncluding this one) as outlined below: The 'Product Essentials' doc is a simplified product price list and product information exchange method that most resellers can use. For other automated ways of transporting product data through APIs, please visit https://www.namm.org/standards

Data Definitions Tab: Contains acceptable values that can be used on the 'Template Tab'. We recommend reviewing Data Definitions tab before creating your file.

Required fields are the minimum values resellers need to onboard supplier products. Required cells are highlighted in GREEN on the various tabs within this doc. Failure to enter a valid value in a required field will prevent resellers from being able to add your products to their systems.

Optional fields provide product information that is helpful, but not critical. Optional fields are highlighted in BLUE on the various tabs within this doc. It is recommended that you provide as much Optional information as possible for your products. Optional information can greatly improve resellers ability to merchandise and promote your products.

Example Tab:  The tab in which actual products can be added and stored. This is the only tab that needs to be provided to resale partners. The other tabs in this document do not need to accompany the final output. See the Example tab for an example on how to enter product information. This product information on the template is for reference only. Please remove examples before providing data to resale partners. 

Template Tab: Is where you will enter the information for your products. For best results, please submit as much optional data as possible. If you are not providing data for a particular non-required field, leave the cell blank. Feel free to add color, boldface, borders and other formatting (not additional text) to the template if it is helpful to you. Note that it is advised to eliminate ASCII characters (such as ®, ©). HTML tags are not supported through this process. 

When you have finished entering your product data into the Template Tab, you can save the entire workbook as an Excel file or you can save the Template Tab (only) as a Text (tab-delimited) (*.txt) file. .csv files are not advised as there may be other delimiters within your data that can causes issues such as commas in some fields.

From time to time, NAMM will update this document, including fields, rules, explanatory text, and requirements. 

If you have read the Instructions or Data Definitions tabs of this file and still have questions, please email standards@namm.org
